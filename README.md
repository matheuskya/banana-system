## About

<a href="https://matheuskya.pythonanywhere.com/main/index/">The project.</a> \\
This is a project inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RELWFGJnKE0&list=LL&index=6&t=86s">this video.</a>
Since I had never built something like this before, I decided to give it a try, and it turned out great!
Through this project, I practiced key skills such as Django, profile management, chatting, and authentication. I hope you enjoy it!

## Setup for Linux Users

### Creating and Activating a Virtual Environment

To set up the project on Linux, follow these steps to create and activate a virtual environment:

1. Open a terminal in your project directory.

2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed:
   ```
   python3 --version
   ```

3. Install the venv module if it's not already installed:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install python3-venv
   ```

4. Create a virtual environment named 'venv':
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

5. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   You should see (venv) appear at the beginning of your terminal prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

6. To deactivate the virtual environment when you're done, simply run:
   ```
   deactivate
   ```

Remember to activate the virtual environment every time you work on the project.
